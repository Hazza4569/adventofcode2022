# Day 3: Ruby

_Packing rucksacks..._

Didn't have much time today so chose a language that I thought might
be easy to pick up. Think Ruby was a good choice.

I didn't think too much about how to actually solve the problems as
most of it was working out the language, so the solutions are very
simple. For part 1: loop over 1 string and check if the character
exists in the other string. For part 2: loop over 1 string and find
all characters in the 2nd string, add these all to a set; then loop
over the set and find which character exists also in the 3rd string.

I liked Ruby. Quite pythonic in feel and syntax but also seems to have
some neat features. I'm quite sure that some of the things I've done
are clunkier than they need to be, would be very interesting to see
what a Ruby expert would change about my code.

Installation-wise: I had a version of ruby already installed in my
Linux distro (ruby 2.6.5p114) so I just used that. This might not be
the ideal version but everything seemed to work.
