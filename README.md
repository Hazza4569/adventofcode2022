# 2022 Advent of Code Solutions

Have decided to try and solve each daily problem in a different
programming language, for as long as this is feasible. I currently
only really know a small handful of languages so this will be an
interesting exercise.

I had already solved the first problem in Python before considering
this, but from now on probably the approach will be to get the more
awkward ones done first.

## So far

Day | Language Used
----|--------------
1   | Python
2   | Bash
3   | Ruby
4   | Java
5   | Go
6   | Rust

## Languages to try

 + C++
 + C
 + JavaScript (/HTML)
 + C#
 + Julia
 + Perl
 + Visual Basic
 + R
 + Mathematica
 + Raku
 + Rust
 + Kotlin
 + Haskell
 + Nim
 + OCaml

Probably for some of these the difficulty will be installing the
necessary tools to compile/run the code
