# Day 6: Rust

_Start of packet markers..._

Continuing the pattern of learning new strongly-typed languages, Rust
today. Focus for this language seems to be on memory safe usage, which
can make some simple things slightly awkward, but I like what I've
seen of the language so far. I even got to use the neat loop-labelling
feature.

Very simple solution here, just used a set to add all the characters
being compared to see if the i-th character is unique amongst the
previous 4 or 14.
